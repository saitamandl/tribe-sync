## Documentation for End-User
I would like to be able to 
- have grocery lists for my personal and group purpose.
- choose items from a list to add to the groceries
- add which brand of item I bought 
- add the cost of the item for a particular brand
- add which supermarket did I buy from
- add a layout (vegetable->snacks->drinks) of the supermarket at a particular location (as supermarket can be in multiple location)
- select which supermarket of which location I am in, so the grocery lists gets sorted based on the layout
- add other expenses separately
- split the cost of the groceries in the groups and users
- settle the balances
- see the expenditure statistics daily/weekly/monthly/yearly basis
- compare prices of the items daily/weekly/monthly/yearly basis
- compare prices between the brands and supermarket
- add tasks and mark them as complete
  - tasks can be repetitive
  - should get a notification
  - calendar sync for the tasks (optional)
## Future ML Ideas
  - Feed the data to a model to predict which items need to be bought
  - How to better manage expenditure.
  - Optimal frequency/time to do the tasks.
